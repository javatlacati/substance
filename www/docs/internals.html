<h1>Substance look and feel - internals</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>If you're interested in knowing more about Substance internals, this document is for you.
It is a rather advanced topic, and it assumes a certain level of familiarity with how Swing
internals work in general. Here is a list of overview articles that provide a glimpse into
how Swing operates:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.pushing-pixels.org/?p=110">Swing painting pipeline</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/09/12/how-to-write-custom-look-and-feel.html">How 
		to write a custom look-and-feel</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2006/10/03/enhancing-swing-applications.html">Enhancing
	Swing applications</a> (especially the first section).</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the document assumes that you're familiar with the basic building blocks 
of Swing painting pipeline and common terms of UI delegates.</p>

<h3>Contact points</h3>

<p>As a UI toolkit, Swing takes care of displaying the application UI controls as pixels on the screen,
and handles the user interaction with those pixels. This process has many steps, most of which can be
configured by the application via custom painting, layered panes, glass panes 
<a href="http://www.pushing-pixels.org/?p=110">and more</a>. Applications that do not use 
these extension points rely on the current look-and-feel to put the pixels on the screen and control
certain aspects of the user interaction.</p>

<p>A look-and-feel is a collection of UI delegates. Each UI delegate handles the specific Swing component
type - buttons have button UI delegates, sliders have slider UI delegates, etc. While each component type
is different, the UI delegates have very similar <strong>contact points</strong> that control the various
aspects of component lifecycle. Here is the list of major contact points:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Configuring the visual settings. This includes colors and fonts.</li>
	<li>Configuring the inner layout metrics. This includes insets, margins and gaps.</li>
	<li>Computing the preferred dimension.</li>
	<li>Layout of inner components for composite controls. This is relevant for controls such
	as combobox which has an inner text field and arrow button.</li>
	<li>Listening to component's model changes. This includes mouse and keyboard, as well
	as change and item listeners - depending on the specific control type.</li>
	<li>Painting the different visual areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, painting is only one contact point among many. In an ideal model-view
separation promoted by the core Swing library, the UI delegate is responsible for anything that
is related to the component's visual and interaction facets.</p>

<h3>Why choose Substance?</h3>
	
<p>Why would you want to use a third-party look-and-feel when core Swing has a number
of 	bundled look-and-feels (including the addition of Nimbus in 6u10+)? Subjective preferences 
about the visuals aside, Substance provides the following features one 
would expect from a modern UI toolkit:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Full high DPI support for the core Swing controls with resolution-independent painting.</li>
	<li>Respecting the desktop font settings of the current environment.</li>
	<li>Built-in animations for the core Swing controls (rollover, selection, ...)</li>
	<li>Skinning layer, and especially decoration areas. The eventual goal is to enable even 
		the most demanding designs to be implemented as self-contained Substance skins 
		that can be ported across different applications in the same portfolio.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Substance implementation</h3>

<p>As a high-level view, the following Substance classes address the four main points above:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceSizeUtils</font></code> has a bunch of 
		methods to compute the different metrics based on the component font size. It makes sure that all the 
		component visuals (borders, gaps, margins, insets, ...) scale and result in consistent physical 
	appearance on various hardware.</li>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceFontUtilities</font></code> has font policy 
	implementations for Windows, Gnome, KDE and Mac desktops.</li>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">FadeTracker</font></code> (to be refactored to use 
		<a href="http://kenai.com/projects/trident/">Trident</a> in the next major Substance version) 
	is the animation engine that powers all built-in animations.</li>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceSkin</font></code> and 
		<code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceColorSchemeBundle</font></code> are the main classes 
	in the skinning layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each Substance UI delegate uses these four classes at different contact points:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceSizeUtils</font></code> is used during the 
		initialization to set up gaps, margins and insets. It is also used during the painting to 
		compute border weights, and in the layout managers to compute the preferred sizes 
		and layout internal sub-components.</li>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceFontUtilities</font></code> is used to 
		populate the <code><font color="darkblue">*.font</font></code> entries in the 
		<code><font color="darkblue">UIManager</font></code> that are later used to set 
		the fonts on the 	components during the initialization stage.</li>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">FadeTracker</font></code> is used in various mouse / 
		change listeners to initiate animation sequences (such as mouse rollover over a button, 
		tab losing selection state) and during the painting to show cross-fades between the states.</li>
	<li><code><font color="darkblue">SubstanceSkin</font></code> is used during the 
		painting to compute the colors for painting the different visual areas of the component.</li>
</ul>
