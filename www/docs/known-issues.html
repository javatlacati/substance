<h1>Substance look and feel - known issues</h1>

This document describes known issues in Substance. Fixing these issues would
involve copying very substantial amount of code from either Metal or Basic
LAF delegates and would entail the following problems:
<ul>
<li>Copyright infringement
<li>Code bloating
<li>Forking and inheriting unfixed bugs
</ul>

These issues have been reported to bugparade and are yet to be officially confirmed.
Each issue has the corresponding internal review ID. Note that a number of other existing
Swing bugs have been either fixed or circumvented in Substance.
