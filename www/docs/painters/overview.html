<h1>Substance look and feel - painters overview</h1>

<p>A Substance <b>painter</b> encapsulates a common painting logic. For example, in Substance,
selected elements in lists, tables, trees and menus are painted with the same
gradients. Instead of replicating this code across different UI delegates,
it is extracted into a common painter. In addition to code reuse, it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Makes it easier to tweak an existing painting sequence.</li>
<li>Lets applications to specify a custom (branding) painter which is 
applied to all relevant controls.</li>
<li>Lets applications and third-party developers to provide consistent
appearance of custom components without locking themselves to 
low-level implementation details of Substance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently, Substance uses five types of painters
which are used on different types of controls and window areas. The core
library bundles a number of painter implementations which are available
as officially supported APIs. Interested applications can also create custom
implementation of the relevant painter interfaces and combine them
together in a skin that creates a unique visual appearance based
on the specific design requirements.</p>

<h3>Painter types</h3>

<p>Currently, Substance uses the following painter types:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="fill.html">Fill painters</a></li>
<li><a href="border.html">Border painters</a></li>
<li><a href="highlight.html">Highlight painters</a></li> 
<li><a href="decoration.html">Decoration painters</a></li> 
<li><a href="overlay.html">Overlay painters</a></li> 
</ul>

<p>The vast majority of Substance visuals are painted by using these 
painters (applying the <a href="../watermarks.html">current watermark</a>
if necessary). The links above provide more technical information on 
how to specify custom painters and how to use them to paint custom
components and window areas. Applications that wish to provide consistent
appearance under different Substance skins are strongly encouraged to 
use the published painter APIs, even if it results in tying the application
code to Substance.</p>

<h3>Painting custom components</h3>

<p>The Substance painting layer provides a convenient
API for the applications that wish to paint custom components
in a way that is consistent with other Substance visuals. More
information can be found in the <a href="custom-skinning.html">skinning
primer</a>.</p>
