<h1>Substance look and feel - custom skinning</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="overview.html">painter overview</a>, most of the
Substance painting logic is abstracted into a set of painters. This not only allows
preventing duplicate painting sequence in the Substance UI delegates. This also
provides a painting layer for the applications that wish to paint custom components
in a way that is consistent with other Substance visuals.</p>

<p>This applies in two major cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing consistent painting for a standalone component suite, such
as <a href="https://swingx.dev.java.net">SwingX</a>.</li>
<li>Providing consistent painting for custom components and visual areas
of a specific application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of trying to match the colors, gradients and animation sequences from
the current Substance skin (which might change between various releases), applications
can use the Substance painting APIs. This will result in code which is shorter,
more maintainable and also produces consistent results.</p>

<h3>Skinning primer</h3>

<p>The following Substance APIs are most suited for painting custom
components:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="fill.html">Fill painters</a></li>
<li><a href="border.html">Border painters</a></li>
<li><a href="decoration.html">Decoration painters</a></li> 
<li><a href="highlight.html">Highlight painters</a></li> 
<li><a href="overlay.html">Overlay painters</a></li> 
<li><a href="../watermarks.html">Watermarks</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the Substance UI delegates use a combination of the above APIs. 
While the exact combination in the existing UI delegates is subject to
change in between releases, you can study the core Substance code to see
the main combination patterns.</p>

<p>The first pattern is <b>watermark overlaying</b>. The 
<a href="../watermarks.html">watermarks</a> are painted on most Swing containers,
and on some components as well. In simpler cases (such as 
<code><font color="darkblue">JPanel</font></code>), the watermark is painted
on top of the gradient fill. In more complex scenarios, after the watermark
has been painted, the fill sequence is repeated with lower alpha
value. Here is an example of such a scenario:</p>

<center><img src="../../images/screenshots/painters/titlepane.png" width=315 height=245></center>

<p>In this scenario, while the regular controls and containers on the content
pane are painted with the regular watermark, the frame header (title pane and 
tool bar) has less "intrusive" watermark painting. This is achieved
by the following sequence:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <a href="decoration.html">decoration painter</a> to paint the decoration
gradient.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="../watermarks.html">watermark</a> to paint the current watermark.</li>
<li>Using the <a href="decoration.html">decoration painter</a> once again, this
time with the <code><font color="darkblue">AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER</font></code>
with alpha value of 0.5.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second pattern is <b>decorating</b>. The <a href="decoration.html">decoration painters</a>
can be used to provide distinct painting to some containers, this setting them "apart" from
the rest of the application. As the pattern name implies, this works best on specialized
containers and visual areas that are situated along the window edges. Here is an example
of <a href="https://swingx.dev.java.net">SwingX</a> <code><font color="darkblue">JXLoginDialog</font></code>
component painted by the
<a href="https://substance-swingx.dev.java.net">Substance SwingX</a> plugin:</p>

<center><img src="../../images/screenshots/painters/jxlogindialog.png" width=408 height=244></center>

<p>In this scenario, the <code><font color="darkblue">JXLoginDialog</font></code> has a 
"decoration" strip located along the top side of the window. To paint the background of this
component, the custom UI delegate is using the current 
<a href="decoration.html">decoration painter</a>, which results in a consistent appearance of
the top portion of this dialog.</p>

<p>Here is another example of this pattern, this time on the 
<code><font color="darkblue">JXStatusBar</font></code> component from
<a href="https://swingx.dev.java.net">SwingX</a> component suite. Assuming that this
component will be placed along the bottom side of the frame, the
matching UI delegate in the
<a href="https://substance-swingx.dev.java.net">Substance SwingX</a> plugin uses the
current <a href="decoration.html">decoration painter</a> to provide a  
distinct appearance of status bar which is consistent with the title pane 
and menu bar:</p>

<center><img src="../../images/screenshots/painters/jxstatusbar.png" width=500 height=350></center>

<p>The third pattern is <b>border tracing</b>. Those components that require consistent
painting of borders or contours can use the 
<a href="border.html">border painter</a> with the matching contour. Here is an example
of border tracing in the <code><font color="darkblue">JRibbon</font></code>
component from <a href="https://flamingo.dev.java.net">Flamingo</a>
component suite under the 
<a href="https://substance-flamingo.dev.java.net">Substance Flamingo</a> plugin:</p>

<center><img src="../../images/screenshots/painters/jribbon.png" width=500 height=160></center>

<p>This UI delegate uses the <a href="border.html">border painter</a> extensively to
create the required visuals. Note the outer contour of the ribbon that also
includes the selected tab button, and the inner contours of the ribbon tasks.</p>

<p>Here is another example of this pattern, this time on the
<code><font color="darkblue">JCommandButton</font></code>
component from <a href="https://flamingo.dev.java.net">Flamingo</a>
component suite. The custom UI delegate uses the border painter to
paint the button border (a simpler contour in this case):</p>

<center><img src="../../images/screenshots/painters/jcommandbutton.png" width=500 height=160></center>

<p>The last pattern is <b>gradient filling</b>. It is used to paint the
inner fill of custom components (along with the border tracing pattern to 
paint the component contour). This pattern uses the 
<a href="fill.html">fill painter</a> with the matching contour. Here is
an example of the <code><font color="darkblue">JRibbon</font></code>
component from <a href="https://flamingo.dev.java.net">Flamingo</a>
component suite:</p>

<center><img src="../../images/screenshots/painters/jtoggletabbutton.png" width=500 height=160></center>

<p>In this example, the first toggle tab button (Write) is painted by the
current <a href="fill.html">fill painter</a>, providing a consistent
appearance with the rest of the application controls. Another example is the previous
screenshot (of the <code><font color="darkblue">JCommandButton</font></code>),
where the button fill is painted by the current fill painter as well.</p>
