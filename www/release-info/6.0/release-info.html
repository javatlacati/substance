    <td width="80%" valign="top">

    <p>The new animation and painter layers support multi-state transitions on all 
    controls that have animations. The old implementation assumed that animating a 
    control always involves two states - previous and current. This assumption is not 
    correct.</p> 
    
    <p>Suppose your buttons are painted with light blue color. When the mouse 
    is over a button, the button is painted with light yellow color, and when the 
    button is pressed, it is painted with saturated orange:</p>
    
    <img src="multi-state.png" width="260" height="110">
    
    <p>Suppose it takes 500ms to complete a single animation. The user moves the mouse 
    over a button, and Substance starts animating the color from light blue to light 
    yellow. Halfway through the animation (250ms), the user presses the button. Now, 
    there are three states participating in the animation: default with light blue, 
    rollover with light yellow and pressed with saturated orange. All the states contribute 
    to the overall appearance of the button as long as the combined animation is in progress.

    <td width="80%" valign="top">

    <p>A typical application button does not change its icon and text. However, the 
    button appearance changes to reflect its state - a disabled button usually has a faded
    or translucent appearance, so that the user can quickly see that it is not 
    clickable. When the user moves the mouse over a button, the button is usually
    painted with a different color to indicate that it is "ready" to be clicked - 
    indication of a rollover state.</p>
    
    <p>Substance 6.0 has significantly extended the functionality of 
    <a href="https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/skins/componentstates.html">component states</a>
    and now allows interested applications to fine tune its appearance under either existing
    core skins or under custom skins.</p>
    
    <p>Here is an example of core <strong>Nebula</strong> skin using a core
    component state facet to change the color schemes used to paint the progress bars:</p>

    <p>Animations in Substance 6.0 are powered by the

    You will need to add the matching Trident jar to your classpath. Substance 6.0
    is using version 1.2 of Trident which can be downloaded from the 
    <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/trident/downloads">main Trident download</a>
    area or from the 
    <a href="https://substance.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=11795">Substance

    <p>In addition to deprecated APIs that have been removed in version 6.0
    (see the <a href="../5.3/release-info.html">release notes for version 5.3</a>),
    application code that uses the following Substance APIs will need to be 
    revisited:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>All <a href="../../docs/painters/overview.html">painter APIs</a> now
    operate on a single <a href="../../docs/skins/colorschemes.html">color
    scheme</a>. Application code that passed two different color schemes
    will now need to call the matching APIs twice, and use the relevant
    composites on the graphics context.</li>
    <li>Configuring the animation settings is now done with the
    <code>org.pushingpixels.lafwidget.animation.AnimationConfigurationManager</code>
    APIs. In addition, application that want to control the resolution
    of the animation pulses should consult the 
    <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/trident/pages/CustomPulseSource">Trident documentation</a>
    on this topic.</li>
