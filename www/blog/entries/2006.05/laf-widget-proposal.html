A few weeks ago i posted <a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t70623.html">a 
question</a> on JavaLobby about the additional "feel" features that i have been adding 
to Substance and what people think about the extra "weight" of the download and the lock-in 
for applications that would like to use these features. When i say lock-in, i mean that these 
features were only available under Substance, which is good for me on one hand, but bad for 
the community in general. Thankfully, one of the responses (by James) proposed splitting the 
Substance code base and making the widgets available to all LAFs. And so the 
<a href="https://laf-widget.dev.java.net">laf-widget</a> project was born.
<br><br>

This project contains a collection of "behavioural traits" or "widgets" for
third-party Swing look-and-feels. The list of currently provided widgets:
<ul>
<li>Auto-completion (model-based / free-text) on editable combo boxes.
</li><li>Hover preview of minimized internal frames on desktop icons.
</li><li>Menu search panel on menu bars.
</li><li>Hover preview of tab in tabbed panes.
</li><li>Overview dialog on tabbed panes.
</li><li>Password strength checker on password fields.
</li><li>Lock border on non-editable text components and model-based editable combo boxes.
</li><li>Select all text in text component on focus gain.
</li><li>Enhanced drag-and-drop support for trees.
</li></ul>

View the <a href="https://laf-widget.dev.java.net/docs/how-to-change-existing-laf.html">detailed 
documentation</a>
on how to enable the above widgets in a specific LAF. Once the steps
described in that document have been completed (by either the LAF developer
or by the LAF user), Swing application running under the
"widgetized" LAF will feature the widgets described above. Here is a sample
application under core <b>Metal</b> and <b>Windows</b> LAFs:

<br><br>

Here is the same application under
<a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">Substance</a> LAF (note the menu search panel
in the menu bar, the tab overview button, the strength markers on password fields and
the lock icons on disabled text field and editable model-only combobox):

The same application under <a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/">JGoodies Looks</a>
Plastic XP, <a href="https://liquidlnf.dev.java.net/">Liquid</a>,

<a href="https://pgslookandfeel.dev.java.net/">Pagosoft</a>,
<a href="http://squareness.sourceforge.net/">Squareness</a>,
<a href="http://www.infonode.net/index.html?ilf">InfoNode</a> and
<a href="http://napkinlaf.sourceforge.net/">Napkin</a> features the same widgets for
the menu bar, combobox, password fields and text fields. Note that the tab overview widget requires
custom LAF support from the relevant LAFs.
