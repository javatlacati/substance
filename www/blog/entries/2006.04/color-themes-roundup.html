<a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">Substance LAF</a> has turned one year old during a 
ten-hour flight over the Atlantic (on April 14) and celebrated this joyous event by providing 
even more color themes than before. The Aqua default theme is of no surprise

<br><br>
And along with it comes a variety of bright themes such as Bottle Green and Sunset

The upcoming release 2.3 features inverted themes (available for all base bright and cold 
themes) such as Inverted Aqua and Inverted Sunset

The latest additions are tinted (shifted towards white), toned (shifted towards gray) and 
shaded (shifted towards black) color themes. Illustrated below are the original (Aqua) color 
theme, 40% tinted, 40% toned and 40% shaded versions of the same theme:

with additional twenty one base themes brings the potential of tens of thousands of original 
color themes to the Java desktop applications. See the 
<a href="../../../docs/themes.html">complete theme documentation</a>
