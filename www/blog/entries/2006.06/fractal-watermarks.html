The latest addition to one of the <a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">Substance</a> 
plugins (<a href="https://substance-watermark-pack.dev.java.net/">watermark pack</a>) 
provides a playground to experiment with fractal-based artwork. Much like the 
<a href="../2006.04/noise-watermarks.html">noise-based 
watermarks</a>, you can play with the API to create your own (and sometimes stunningly 
beautiful) watermarks.<br><br>

The code is loosely based on the ideas from the <a href="http://flam3.com/">flam3</a> 
site (see <a href="http://flam3.com/flame.pdf">this PDF</a> for some math). Feel free 
to explore some of the 
<a href="https://substance-watermark-pack.dev.java.net/source/browse/substance-watermark-pack/src/org/jvnet/substance/watermarkpack/flamefractal/">code 
right here</a>. Here are some examples of the fractal flame watermarks along with the 
source code (the parameters are highly random chosen to create some interesting images. 
The first parameter is the degree of symmetry).<br><br>

The first image is that of <b>kaleidoscope</b> and is obtained by the following code 
(note the degree of symmetry is 4):
<pre>
public class Kaleidoscope extends IteratedFunctionSystem {
   public Kaleidoscope() {
      super(4, new Functions.SphericalFunction(0.365654, 0.18286, 0.23786324,
            0.234234, -0.4123234, 0.312123),
            new Functions.ExFunction(0.234234, 0.987234, 0.23786324,
                  0.5345456, -0.98456465, 0.312123),
            new Functions.SphericalFunction(0.88745, -0.8934734, -0.546312,
                  0.7896, -0.445899, 0.132468));
   }
}
</pre>

<br><br>

The second one is <b>vortex</b> and is obtained by the following code (no symmetry added):
<pre>
public class Vortex extends IteratedFunctionSystem {
   public Vortex() {
      super(1, new Functions.HorseShoeFunction(-0.654897, 0.16886, -0.32645,
            0.0598, 0.952376, -0.231534),
            new Functions.HorseShoeFunction(0.31378, 0.451321, -0.234235,
                  -0.321534, -0.12436, -0.761234));
   }
}
</pre>

<br><br>

The third one is <b>singularity</b> and is obtained by the following code (degree of symmetry 2):
<pre>
package org.jvnet.substance.watermarkpack.flamefractal;
public class Singularity extends IteratedFunctionSystem {
   public Singularity() {
      super(2, new Functions.SphericalFunction(0.365654, 0.987234, 0.23786324,
            0.234234, -0.4123234, 0.312123),
            new Functions.SphericalFunction(0.67656, 0.8934734, -0.546312,
                  -0.7896, -0.65487, 0.132468));
   }
}
</pre>

<br><br>

The last one is <b>scriptures</b> (my favourite - just trace all the repetitive nested 
marks) and is obtained by the following code (no symmetry added):
<pre>
public class Scriptures extends IteratedFunctionSystem {
   public Scriptures() {
      super(1, new Functions.HorseShoeFunction(-0.654897, 0.16886, -0.32645,
            0.0598, 0.452376, -0.231534),
            new Functions.HorseShoeFunction(0.31378, 0.451321, -0.234235,
                  -0.321534, -0.12436, -0.761234));
   }
}
</pre>
