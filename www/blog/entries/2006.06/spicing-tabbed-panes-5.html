This entry describes the new feature available in the next version of 
<a href="../../../">Substance look-and-feel</a> (code-named Grenada) 
and any other third-party LAF using <a href="https://laf-widget.dev.java.net">laf-widget</a> 
layer.
<br><br>

First, you're welcome to read 
<a href="../2006.05/laf-widget-proposal.html">this 
blog entry</a> that introduces the notion of <b>widget</b> into the world of look-and-feels. 
While <a href="https://substance.dev.java.net">Substance</a> LAF is currently the only LAF 
supporting the "feel" widgets, the approach has been successfuly tested on six other 
third-party LAFs (Squareness, Pagosoft, Looks, Liquid, Infonode and Napkin. While the previous 
four parts described Substance-specific features, the introduction of <b>laf-widget</b> now 
allows additional third-party LAFs to provide tab overview dialog and tab hover preview.
<br><br>

The new addition to <b>laf-widget</b> layer provides the functionality of 
<a href="http://extensions.hesslow.se/">Ctrl Tab</a> Firefox plugin. Once you install that 
plugin, pressing <b>Ctrl+Tab</b> opens three windows, one in the middle that shows a large 
thumbnail of a tab (starts from the current tab), and two side windows displaying small 
thumbnails of previous and next tabs. Each press on <b>Tab</b> key (while <b>Ctrl</b> is 
pressed) moves the thumbnails forward (cycling). Once <b>Ctrl</b> is released, the currently 
shown tab (in the middle thumbnail window) is selected.<br><br>

For those of you who don't know, Swing already provides keyboard accelerators for switching 
the tabs. These are <b>Ctrl+Page Up</b> for moving forward and <b>Ctrl+Page Down</b> for moving 
backward. Two major disadvantages are:
<ul>
<li>The selection actually changes (which may trigger some application event handlers - may be 
undesirable if the user just wants to see the tab preview).
<li>It only works in the current tab run.
</ul>

The newly added (quite small ~10K) widget in <b>laf-widget</b> project (and subsequently in the 
new version of Substance) provides the <b>Ctrl+Right Arrow</b> and <b>Ctrl+Left Arrow</b> keyboard 
shortcuts that provide thumbnail paging of all tabs in the currently focused tabbed pane 
(<b>Ctrl+Tab</b> can not be taken since <b>Tab</b> event is already consumed by Swing for the 
focus transfer). Here is a screenshot to illustrate (click to see the full size):<br><br>
