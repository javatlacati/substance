<a href="../2005.10/spicing-tabbed-panes-1.html">This entry</a> 
describes the capabilities that release 2.1 of <a href="../../..">Substance 
look-and-feel</a> provides for your tabbed panes. They are:
<ul>
<li>Animation effect for tabs with modified (and unsaved) content
<li>Close buttons on tabs with listeners
</ul>

Following the feedback from the users (thanks Raj), the latest daily drop of version 2.2 
(code-named <b>El Paso</b>) provides even more functionality available to your Swing application 
once you start using <b>Substance LAF</b>.<br><br>

The first request was to enhance the listener mechanism on close buttons of tabbed panes. 
As mentioned in the above blog, you can register any number of listeners that will be called 
when close button of some tab in some tabbed pane is clicked. The <b>CloseTabListener</b> 
interface defines the following two methods:

<pre style="border: 1px solid darkgray; padding: 4px; color: darkblue;">
/**
 * Called when a tab is about to be closed.
 */
public void tabClosing(JTabbedPane tabbedPane, Component tabComponent);

/**
 * Called when a tab is closed.
 */
public void tabClosed(JTabbedPane tabbedPane, Component tabComponent);
</pre>

There were two separate requests regarding this mechanism:
<ol>
<li>Allow the application listener to veto the tab closing
<li>Allow registering listeners per tabbed pane (and not globally)
</ol>

Now, if you want to provide additional logic and veto the tab closing, you need to implement 
the <b>VetoableTabCloseListener</b> that extends the <b>TabCloseListener</b> and adds the 
following function:
<pre style="border: 1px solid darkgray; padding: 4px; color: darkblue;">
/**
 * Called when a tab is about to be closed. Can veto the tab closing.
 *
 * @return <code>true</code> if the corresponding tab shouldn't be closed,
 *         <code>false</code> otherwise.
 */
public boolean vetoTabClosing(JTabbedPane tabbedPane,
	Component tabComponent);
</pre>

All vetoable listeners that are either registered for the specific tabbed pane, or are 
registered globally (for all tabbed panes) are called when the close icon is clicked. 
If at least one of them returns <b>false</b>, the tab will not be closed. Otherwise, 
the <b>tabClosing</b> and <b>tabClose</b> functions will be called. A simple example 
is to show the confirmation dialog as:

<pre style="border: 1px solid darkgray; padding: 4px; color: darkblue;">
public void tabClosed(JTabbedPane tabbedPane,
            Component tabComponent) {
  System.out.println("Closed tab - specific");
}

public void tabClosing(JTabbedPane tabbedPane,
            Component tabComponent) {
  System.out.println("Closing tab - specific");
}

public boolean vetoTabClosing(JTabbedPane tabbedPane,
            Component tabComponent) {
  int userCloseAnswer = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(
      Check.this,
      "Are you sure you want to close this tab?",
      "Confirm dialog", JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION);
  return (userCloseAnswer == JOptionPane.NO_OPTION);
}
</pre>
The following dialog will be shown to the user when the tab close button is clicked:<br><br>
<img src="../../close-tab-dialog.png" width=268 height=118>
<br><br>

Note that this extension doesn't break the existing API which is still fully supported 
and provides the exact same functionality as before.<br><br>

The second request was to provide an option for drawing vertical rotated tabs when the 
current placement for the tabbed pane is either <b>LEFT</b> or <b>RIGHT</b>. The solutions 
described elsewhere 
(by <a href="http://jroller.com/comments/santhosh/Weblog/adobe_like_tabbedpane_in_swing">Santosh</a> 
and <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/03/22/vertical_text.html">Lee Ann</a>) 
involve a composite icon that simulates the tab and effectively hides the text from the 
tabbed pane UI delegate (by putting it in the icon and rotating the entire icon). The 
above solutions work, but involve using third-party classes and changing your code to use 
these classes. In addition, since <b>Substance</b> provides the close buttons on tabs, they 
are not easily applicable.<br><br>

<b>Substance</b> provides unintrusive solution for rotated vertical tabs. There are two 
properties that you can set:
<ul>
<li><b>SubstanceLookAndFeel.TABBED_PANE_VERTICAL_ORIENTATION</b> is set on a tabbed pane 
or on UIManager (or both) and instructs the UI delegate to use vertical (rotated) layout 
for the LEFT and RIGHT-placed tabbed panes.
<li><b>SubstanceLookAndFeel.TABBED_PANE_VERTICAL_ORIENTATION_ROTATE_ICONS</b> is set a 
tab, a tabbed pane or on UIManager (or any combination) and instructs the UI delegate 
to leave the icon unrotated.
</ul>
Note that if you don't wish to create the explicit dependency in your code on the 
<b>SubstanceLookAndFeel</b> class, you can use the string values for the above properties. 
Here are a few screenshots to illustrate the outcome, followed by code samples:
<ul>
<li>
<b>TOP</b>-placed tabbed pane with five tabs. Each tab has text, icon and a close 
button (visible when the tab is either selected or under mouse):
<br><br>
<img src="../../../release-info/2.2/tabs-horizontal.png" width=406 height=26>
<li>
<b>LEFT</b>-placed tabbed pane under standard layout. Note that the tabs are not 
rotated and take too much horizontal space:
<br><br>
<img src="../../../release-info/2.2/tabs-vertical-old.png" width=143 height=153>
<li>
Four parts of the image, from left to right:
<ul>
<li><b>LEFT</b>-placed tabbed pane with vertical layout. The first tab has unrotated 
icon, the third tab has unrotated icon which is also disabled, all other tabs have rotated icons.
<li><b>LEFT</b>-placed tabbed pane with vertical <b>and</b> scroll layout. The icons are same as above.
<li><b>RIGHT</b>-placed tabbed pane with vertical <b>and</b> scroll layout. The icons are same as above.
<li><b>RIGHT</b>-placed tabbed pane with vertical layout. The icons are same as above.
</ul>
<br><br>
<img src="../../../release-info/2.2/tabs-vertical.png" width=273 height=317>
</ul>

Here is how the tabs in the last examples were created:
<pre style="border: 1px solid darkgray; padding: 4px; color: darkblue;">
JTabbedPane jtp = new JTabbedPane();
TabNumberedPanel tnp1 = new TabNumberedPanel(jtp, 1);
tnp1.putClientProperty(
  <b>SubstanceLookAndFeel.TABBED_PANE_VERTICAL_ORIENTATION_ROTATE_ICONS,
  Boolean.TRUE</b>);
jtp.addTab("tab1", SubstanceImageCreator.getThemeIcon(null), tnp1);
jtp.addTab("tab2", SubstanceImageCreator.getThemeIcon(null),
    new TabNumberedPanel(jtp, 2));
TabNumberedPanel tnp3 = new TabNumberedPanel(jtp, 3);
tnp3.putClientProperty(
  <b>SubstanceLookAndFeel.TABBED_PANE_VERTICAL_ORIENTATION_ROTATE_ICONS,
  Boolean.TRUE</b>);
jtp.addTab("tab3", SubstanceImageCreator.getThemeIcon(null), tnp3);
jtp.addTab("tab4", SubstanceImageCreator.getHexaMarker(4,
    SubstanceLookAndFeel.getTheme()), new TabNumberedPanel(jtp,
    4));
jtp.addTab("tab5", SubstanceImageCreator.getHexaMarker(5,
    SubstanceLookAndFeel.getTheme()), new TabNumberedPanel(jtp,
    5));
jtp.setEnabledAt(2, false);
jtp.setEnabledAt(3, false);
jtp.putClientProperty(
  <b>SubstanceLookAndFeel.TABBED_PANE_VERTICAL_ORIENTATION, true</b>);
</pre>

Note that you get the desired behaviour by setting a few client properties, which 
have no effect under other look-and-feels.<br><br>

The only limitation of this technique is for tabs that support arbitrary components 
(added in Mustang, described in 
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/alexfromsun/archive/2005/11/tabcomponents_i_1.html">this 
blog entry</a> by Alexander Potochkin). Such tabs will not be rotated correctly, since 
these components are not painted using the UI delegates at all. I have discussed this 
with Alexander and he pointed out additional problem - the need to translate mouse 
coordinates to allow the tab component to correctly handle the events. The bottom line 
(at least for Mustang) is - do not use this feature if your application is using the 
new <b>JTabbedPane</b> functions (which automatically implies that it's running under Mustang).

<br><br>
One last thing - if you like <b>Substance</b>, help internationalize it! (small print - 
eternal glory is not guaranteed :) Starting from version 2.2 (code-named <b>El Paso</b>) 
the additional UI elements (system menu items, heap status panel, menu search panel) 
are internationalized. You are welcome to view 
<a href="../../../docs/internationalization.html">the list of 
available translations</a> and send me additional translations to <b>kirillcool [at] 
yahoo.com</b>. Thanks in advance
