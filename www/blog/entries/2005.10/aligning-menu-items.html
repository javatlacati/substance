Does the following look familiar (under default Ocean theme in Metal LAF)?<br>

The menu doesn't look good, with jagged items all over the place. The common solution in 
this scenario is to use a transparent icon on those menu items that don't have one. There 
are a few problems with this approach:
<ul>
<li>What happens if you add another menu item with slightly wider icon? You will have to 
adjust all other icons accordingly.
<li>What happens with <b>JCheckBoxMenuItem</b>s and <b>JRadioButtonMenuItem</b>s? Once you 
have those, it's almost impossible to get it done correctly, especially if they have icons 
themselves.
<li>There is no <b>JMenu</b> constructor that gets an icon. You'll have to call <b>setIcon()</b>.
<li>The last, but most certainly the most annoying - why should <b>you</b> even bother to do this?
</ul>

The answer to the last question lies in the <b>BasicMenuItemUI</b> class that does the 
actual layout and rendering - <b>it's looking at one menu item at a time</b>. It's not 
even aware that the specific menu item is a part of visual group, so it happily hacks 
(and quite ugly) at the corresponding menu item, and the result is far from perfect:<br>

(the above is Windows LAF from JDK).<br><br>
To the rescue come custom look-and-feels. <a href="https://looks.dev.java.net">JGoodies 
Looks</a> comes equiped with custom menu item renderer. It keeps track of the maximum 
text offset on the menu item parent (<b>JPopupMenu</b> in our case), and once the rendering 
should be done, the offset is taken from the parent (client property). The result is much 
more satisfying (see <a href="https://looks.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=61">this issue</a> 
and Karsten's comment below regarding the layout <b>JCheckBoxMenuItem</b>s and 
<b>JRadioButtonMenuItem</b>s with icons - the check marks are drawn underneath the icons):<br>

<a href="../../..">Substance</a> LAF takes a different approach, 
inheriting from <b>BasicMenuItemUI</b> and overriding the function that computes the 
text offset. It does the same as JGoodies, but for every menu item, it goes over all 
entries in the parent component (<b>JPopupMenu</b>) and computes the maximal text offset. 
This approach is more time consuming but also more dynamic. The result is:<br>

This also works on "real" application, such as NetBeans:<br>
