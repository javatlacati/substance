Yesterday i have stumbled upon <a href=" http://developer.apple.com/qa/qa2001/qa1146.html">this 
entry</a> from Apple developer zone. It shows how to indicate that a document window 
(frame in Swing application) has changed contents. The indication is similar to that of 
regular Mac application (dark dot in the close button). The way to accomplish this is to 
put a <b>windowModified</b> client property with <b>Boolean.TRUE</b> value on either the 
<b>JRootPane</b> or on the <b>JInternalFrame</b>.<br><br>
This, of course, is Mac-specific, and does not have Swing support on other platforms. 
That is, until now (kind of). The latest drop of <a href="../../..">Substance</a> 
version 2.1 provides just that - a pulsating close button of <b>JFrame</b>, <b>JInternalFrame</b> 
and <b>JDesktopIcon</b> when the above property is set to <b>Boolean.TRUE</b>. You can 
view it in action in <a href="../../../release-info/2.1/windows-contents.avi">this 
movie</a> (31-second, 526KB, originally WMV format, but should play as AVI too). In addition, 
you can run the <a href="../../../webstart/test.jnlp">Web Start 
demo</a> to see it in action. Go to "Desktop" tab, click on "add" button and click on 
"Mark changed" in the new internal frame. Here are few screenshots from the movie:

    Pulsating loop on <b>JInternalFrame</b> - tooltip on close button in unsaved state:

    Pulsating loop on <b>JDesktopIcon</b>:

    Pulsating loop on <b>JFrame</b>:

Note that the close button is painted in red and pulsates every 5 seconds, changing its 
theme from red to yellow and back to red in two seconds.
