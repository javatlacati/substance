For me it all started with one of the first versions of ACDSee that provided watermark 
drawings on its toolbar. But lately, I have seen a couple of screenshots of JEdit, and a 
thought hit me:<br>
<img src="http://jedit.org/jedit-snap-25.thumbnail.png"><img src="http://jedit.org/jedit-snap-14.thumbnail.png"><br><br>

Why only for the class editor? Why not for the whole application? And why not make it 
available for any Java application? So, the beta of the upcoming 
<a href="../../..">Substance</a> look-and-feel release 2.0 provides 
the <b>watermarking</b> support (the only one besides <a href="http://www.desnoix.com/guillaume/slaf/">SLAF</a> 
as far as i know).<br><br>

First of all, you are welcome to try it out for yourself with 
<a href="../../../webstart/test.jnlp">WebStart</a> test application 
(or by downloading the <a href="../../../files/documents/3294/13612/substance.jar">runnable 
jar</a>). And here is how the out-of-the-box watermarks look like (click on each screenshot 
to see large screenshot):<br>

<br><br>
Notice how the watermarks (the first one is simple stripes, the second one is Matrix-inspired 
Katakana glyphs and the last one is foam bubbles) are stamped on almost everything (including 
toolbar and menus) without getting in the way. For the Eclipse warheads, here is an IntelliJ 
IDEA screenshot:<br>

<br><br>

But it doesn't end here. Using a custom watermark (which is quite easy to implement), you 
can turn your favourite Swing-based IDE to a unique opportunity to see your favourite 
actress all day long :)

Don't let your wife catch you, but once she does, simply point out that you are working. 
For all the open-source slashdot hippies, you can even go a step further, but don't let Linus 
catch you:<br>

In addition, the watermark image may come not only from local filesystem, but from the Web 
as well (added as requested in the comments). The image below is NetBeans in <b>Sunset</b> 
theme with watermark of Beyonce image (that matches the theme colors). The command to run 
NetBeans is <font color="darkgreen">H:\netbeans-4.2dev\bin\netbeans.exe -cp:p h:\jprojects\substance\drop\substance.jar 
-laf org.jvnet.substance.SubstanceLookAndFeel -J-Dsubstancelaf.theme=org.jvnet.substance.theme.SubstanceSunsetTheme
